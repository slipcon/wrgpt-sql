wrgpt-sql

Code to sync, parse, and query interesting information from WRGPT


Requires:
	perl
	postgresql
	rsync
	wget
	graphviz


Usage:
	This is all driven by the makefile right now.
	Edit the makefile if you want to change the name of the database to use

	> make sync
	> make reload
	> make stats
	> make graph
	> make hist PLAYER="Player Name"

        Note:  The last step of the reload is updating the eliminations 
	table to account for what I consider to be a bug in the
	eliminations.xml feed.   The wrgpt floormen disagree.

	If a player is eliminated in a hand where the winners have a split
	pot, eliminations.xml lists the "hitman" as "Player One Player Two"
	with no delimination.   Since player names can be any number of
	words, there isn't a good way to automatically handle this.

	If the import ends and it prints the name of a player, that 
	player has been eliminated by more than one player.  You'll 
	need to go look up the hand and add two lines to the end of
	sql/finish-setup.sql to manually add the elimination, and then
	reload again.


TODO:
	- Incremental load.   Right now the only way to update the data is 
	  to blow away the database and reload.  It only takes a few
	  minutes, but it would be nice to do incremental load.
